bashnapi comes with it's own test suite and environment. It relys on a couple of dependencies

- vagrant
- virtualbox
- perl with Test::More and prove installed

The suite creates a dedicated virtual machine basing on a ubuntu presice 12.04 32 bit box. It must be available in vagrant. 
In order to add execute:

	$ vagrant box add hashicorp/precise32

In order to prepare the environment and run the tests bring the vagrant box first:

	$ vagrant up

and use the run_tests.sh wrapper to start the env preparations and execute the test themselves. When run for the first time it will try to download and compile all the necessary packages - be prepared that it may take some time.
